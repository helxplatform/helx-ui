# HeLx UI

This is a [React](reactjs.org/) app created with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Development

For local React development you can get started with:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
set -a && source .env && bin/populate_env public/env.json
npm install
npm start
```

NOTE: You must run `make init` once you've cloned the repo to enable the commit-msg git hook so that conventional commits will apply automatically.

### Appstore backend

### Appstore local development

Using a local installation of Appstore:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helxplatform/appstore.git
cd appstore
cp .env.sample .env
make install
make start
```

NOTE: This cannot launch apps due to running in stub mode, but will allow login (with
Django admin, see details below for social login) and serve up some stubbed data.
The default user is when running Appstore locally is username: admin and password: admin.

Refer to the [Appstore repo](https://github.com/helxplatform/appstore/) for more info.

### Appstore in Kubernetes

You can install the `helx` helm chart as detailed [here](https://github.com/helxplatform/helm-charts/blob/develop/deploy-helx.md)
and port forward so that the appstore endpoints are available to your local network space.

```bash
# Port-forward Appstore to http://localhost:8000
kubectl port-forward service/helx-nginx 8000:80
```

Navigate to the site at `http://localhost:8000/`.

With this setup appstore and tycho will use your local cluster enabling full
interaction with launched app instances.

### Local UI with Appstore in Kubernetes

TODO. This isn't supported as of yet Production Appstore doesn't set CORS
headers on any requests. In order for login/user sessions to work properly,
you'd need to run the local UI and external Appstore instance on the same origin
to properly share session information.

## Environment Config

HeLx-UI works by generating an `env.json` file from your environment that is used within the app.
For development purposes, you only need to generate the env.json once. Afterwards, you can modify it
directly rather than regenerating it.

See `.env.example` for the most up to date variables and appropriate default values.
- `REACT_APP_REACT_APP_WORKSPACES_ENABLED`: enables workspaces functionality (requires Appstore)
- `REACT_APP_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_ENABLED`: enables semantic search functionality
- `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SPACE`: identify default landing space: workspaces | search | support
- `REACT_APP_HELX_SEARCH_URL`: points the UI to the Dug semantic search API
- `REACT_APP_UI_BRAND_NAME`: heal | braini | catalyst | scidas | eduhelx | helx
- `REACT_APP_TRANQL_ENABLED`: enables the TranQL visualization pane in search results
- `REACT_APP_TRANQL_URL`: points the UI to the TranQL deployment
- `REACT_APP_HIDDEN_SUPPORT_SECTIONS`: hides support page sections, if necessary
- `REACT_APP_DOCKSTORE_BRANCH`: used to point the UI to an alternative Dockstore branch
- `REACT_APP_APPSTORE_ASSET_BRANCH`: used to point the UI to an alternative Appstore branch to load static assets

### Generate env.json

```bash
set -a
source .env
bin/populate_env public/env.json
```

Once you've generated an env.json file, it's usually easier to just tweak the file directly
rather than running `populate_env` again.

## Appstore login configuration

Out of the box the `admin` account is configured and available for use. For
some dev this login may be enough to test changes or validate an update, but
for testing a more standard user login view/flow you will want to use one
of the social login options.

In order to use SSO login options, you'll need to be running Appstore in Kubernetes.
Refer to [this](https://wiki.renci.org/index.php?title=Kubernetes_Cloud/Helx#OAuth_Setup_for_HeLx_Authentication)
wiki article for how to setup these providers.

For UNC/Onyen SAML login, you'll need to send in a ticket to ITS requesting for them to register a SAML entity for you.
You can register a ticket [here](https://help.unc.edu/sp) by clicking Report an Issue.

## CICD
This project uses github actions to test, build, and release both development and new release images depending on the branch code is merged to. A development image is built upon merge to the develop branch and a new relelase is created, tagged (based on Semver) when merging to the main/master branch.

#### Fail on Vulnerability Detection

During PR's several vulnerability scanners are run. If there are vulnerabilities detected, the pr checks will fail and a report will be sent to Github Security Dashboard for viewing. Please ensure the vulnerability is mitigated prior to continuing the merge to protected branches.
